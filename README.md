# Covid19Panel
I was eager to do data analysis on the Covid19 Outbreak data but I was frustrated by a lack of data that could easily be worked. 

This project downloads the [2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19), converts it into panel data, and makes some basic figures.
