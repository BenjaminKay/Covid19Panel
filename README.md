# Covid19Panel
I was eager to do data analysis on the Covid19 Outbreak data but I was frustrated by a lack of data that could easily studied. Most of what I could find was either not up to date (such as the r package [coronavirus](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/coronavirus/)) or lacked global data (such as the r package [nCov2019](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/nCov2019)). This code remedies that situation by making a tidy panel data set in r.

This project downloads the [2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19), converts it into panel data, and makes some basic figures.
